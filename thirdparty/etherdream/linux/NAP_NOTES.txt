Built from source in NAP thirdparty repo on Ubuntu 16.04 with GCC 5.4.0

After building set soname like so:
patchelf --set-soname libetherdream.so bin/libetherdream.so

The Makefile is original and should be used for compiling on Linux. The CMakeLists.txt was created for
building on Android and should be used via build_android.py
